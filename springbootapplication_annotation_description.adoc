Spring Initializr adds the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation to our main class. `@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

- `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application
context.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Spring Boot attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the dependencies that you have added.
- `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and
services. If specific packages are not defined, recursive scanning begins with the package of the class that declares the annotation.
